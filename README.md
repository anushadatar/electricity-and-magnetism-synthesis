# Anusha Datar Electricty and Magnetism Synthesis
Olin College Electricity and Magnetism FA 2018 Final Project : E &amp; M Concept Map
Hosted on Github because synchronzing different products is hard.

Final product is in top-level directory (named Anusha-final-concept-map.html). Maybe on Github pages, if this ever gets done :)

Uploaded with TODOs for book chapters. Still need to do waves

Ideas of things to add/check:
- Units for every red box concept + bolding
- When is Gauss useful
- Main concept maps
- Electric dipole torque
- Pick an image type
- Make our man maxwell more central
